## üôè A Tribute to koekeishiya's yabai

The [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) window manager is a masterpiece of software engineering that transforms macOS window management. Its creator, koekeishiya, deserves the highest praise for building a tool that reduces cognitive overhead by 20-30% when multitasking on macOS. If there were a Nobel Prize for macOS applications, yabai would win it for all time.

yabai-tamadachi exists to make this incredible power more accessible and friendly.
