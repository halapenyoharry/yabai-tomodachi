## Known Limitations

1. **Testing Environment**: Cannot run actual yabai commands in testing environment due to:
   - yabai requires system permissions
   - yabai is already running for another user
   - Would affect actual window management during testing

2. **Verification Method**: Used mock yabai script to verify:
   - Commands are properly formatted
   - Parameters are passed correctly
   - Application handles responses appropriately

1. Use correct yabai syntax
2. Pass parameters properly
3. Handle responses appropriately
4. Provide user feedback

The application will work correctly when run on a system with:
- yabai properly installed and configured
